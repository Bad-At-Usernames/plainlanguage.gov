    Join us on Wednesday, January 8, 2020, from 2-3:30 p.m. online or on the phone.
    <br/><br/>The new year is upon us and we have a lot of potential topics to cover in our monthly meetings, but we’d prefer to gauge our members’ interest beforehand. What topics do you think we should be covering? Who should we be inviting to talk? What would should we accomplish together in #2020?
